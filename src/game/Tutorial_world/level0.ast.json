Statements can be proved by `refl` when the left hand side is excatly the same as the\nright hand side (\"definitionally equal\"). And `rw` stands for \"rewrite\", substituting the LHS of an equality in an hypothesis h with the RHS. \n\nFor every theorem, your goal will be the mathematical statement with a `⊢` just before it.\nWe will use tactics to manipulate and ultimately close these goals.\n\nLet's see how the `refl` tactic works, as a warm-up. \n\nThe first step for every level in this game is to click on the word `sorry` and then delete it (it's just a filler word for syntax purposes).\nFor this lemma, the `refl` tactic will close the goal, as both side are *exactly* the same. \n"},{"end":[35,0],"start":[33,2],"text":" Lemma : no-side-bar\nFor all natural numbers $x$, we have $x = x$.\n"},{"end":[49,0],"start":[45,2],"text":"\n \nFor each level, the idea is to get Lean into this state: with the top right\nbox saying \"Proof complete!\" and the bottom right box empty (i.e. with no errors in).\n"},{"end":[57,0],"start":[51,2],"text":"\n\n## Summary\n\n· `refl` closes goals of the form `X = X`.\n\n"}],"expr":[null,{"const":["nat",[]]},{"local":{"bi":0,"name":"x","pp":"x","type":1}},{"local":{"bi":0,"name":"x","pp":"x","type":1}},{"const":["eq",[]]},{"app":[4,2]},{"app":[5,3]},{"const":[["interactive","executor","execute_explicit"],[]]},{"const":["tactic",[]]},{"app":[7,8]},{"const":[["has_bind","seq"],[]]},{"const":[["has_bind","seq"],[]]},{"const":[["tactic","save_info"],[]]},{"const":[[4,"_",153],[]]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"38"}},{"app":[13,14]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"0"}},{"app":[15,16]},{"annotation":{"args":[17],"name":"anonymous_constructor"}},{"app":[12,18]},{"app":[11,19]},{"const":[["has_bind","seq"],[]]},{"const":[["has_bind","seq"],[]]},{"const":[["tactic","save_info"],[]]},{"const":[[4,"_",154],[]]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"39"}},{"app":[24,25]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"2"}},{"app":[26,27]},{"annotation":{"args":[28],"name":"anonymous_constructor"}},{"app":[23,29]},{"app":[22,30]},{"const":[["tactic","istep"],[]]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"39"}},{"app":[32,33]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"2"}},{"app":[34,35]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"39"}},{"app":[36,37]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"2"}},{"app":[38,39]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"20"}},{"app":[40,41]},{"const":[["tactic","interactive","refl"],[]]},{"app":[42,43]},{"app":[31,44]},{"app":[21,45]},{"const":[["tactic","save_info"],[]]},{"const":[[4,"_",155],[]]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"43"}},{"app":[48,49]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"1"}},{"app":[50,51]},{"annotation":{"args":[52],"name":"anonymous_constructor"}},{"app":[47,53]},{"app":[46,54]},{"app":[20,55]},{"app":[10,56]},{"const":[["tactic","save_info"],[]]},{"const":[[4,"_",156],[]]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"43"}},{"app":[59,60]},{"prenum":{"args":[],"value":"0"}},{"app":[61,62]},{"annotation":{"args":[63],"name":"anonymous_constructor"}},{"app":[58,64]},{"app":[57,65]},{"app":[9,66]},{"annotation":{"args":[67],"name":"by"}}],"file":1,"level":["0"]}
